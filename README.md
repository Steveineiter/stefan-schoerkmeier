# stefan-schoerkmeier
My personal web page which showcases my skills as a fullstack developer. 

TODO add steps to run it locally. 

## Plan
1. create backend / ml model call
2. train model / make weights accessible
3. create prediction via swagger-ui
4. implement frontend
5. everything should work on my machine xD
6. Create ci/cd pipeline, let in run locally on docker
7. Purchase schoerkmeier.dev domain and deploy on AWS


# Lessons learned
## AI in workflow
- Automatically creating git messages or pull requests is hard, since locally hosted my GPU is too weak (GTX 1070) and for other options i would need an API key
  - Thus for now i will simply use you.com and paste my code after im done for a file / milestone to get feedback.
  - For the commits, i will write them by hand for now, maybe using an api key later after i have set up the feedback-chatbot.
