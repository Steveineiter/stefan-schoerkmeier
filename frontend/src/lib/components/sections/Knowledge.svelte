    <h3>Health & Lifestyle</h3>
    <p>Health is the most important thing we can have. I think most people would agree. Unfortunately there is so much
    misinformation out there and many people think diet, for example, is really confusing - me included (I tried many
      sorts of diet - keto, carnivore, mediterranean, vegan, ...) . This is interesting,
    because we already know the rough steps to take since the 1980's. Obviously, if you have allergies or an illness these
    findings might not apply to you - but for 90% or so of the population they do. According to
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2q5qC7NLMY" target="_blank">Dr. Gardner</a> those 7 things are:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Eat a variety of Foods </li>
      <li>Maintain Ideal Weight </li>
      <li>Avoid too much Fat, Saturated Fat and Cholesterol </li>
      <li>Eat foods with Adequate Starch and Fiber </li>
      <li>Avoid too much Sugar </li>
      <li>Avoid too much Salt </li>
      <li>If you drink alcohol, do so in moderation </li>
    </ol>
    <p>From <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5s2U4GGBZak" target="_blank">newer research</a> we know that alcohol is even bad
    in low doses. The cool part about those 7 things is, that we can <b>easily know whether something is healthy</b> or not.
    Eating a Wiener Schnitzel with fries, a dessert, and a beer each day? Unhealthy since we are breaking each of the findings above
    (except they are really small portions and you eat great for the rest of the day).
    For me, the best diet to archive that is a <b>plant based whole food</b> diet with 1-2 portions of meat/fish per week.
    Because with that I fulfill those 7 findings by default while still being flexible enough to going out dining with friends.
    </p>
    <p> Besides diet, <b>sleep and exercise</b> are the other parts of a healthy life. In a nutshell we want 7-9 hours
      of high quality sleep, 2-3 hours of weight lifting and 2-3 hours of moderate cardio per week for optimal health.
      I personally would also add <b>ergonomics</b> (workspace and for sleep) and <b>stress management</b> (meditation, yoga nidra, progressive muscle relaxation)
    </p>

    <p>If you wonder, <b>why I only cite science based sources</b> the reason is simple: Time & results. The amazing thing with science
    is, that it will work for most people. With that I know I will have great progress with a fraction of time investment I would need to make
    if I follow the advice of a random Influencer (which might even do harm) and try out EVERYTHING whether it works for me or not.</p>

    <h2>Books that taught me a lot</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><b>How to Win Friends & Influence People (Dale Carnegie)</b> - amazing book, I think everybody should read this </li>
      <li><b>Awaken the Giant Within (Anthony Robbins)</b> - if you have read one selfhelpbook you have read them all, but I
      liked this one. I got my most important mind set through this book: I can always grow to the kind of person I want to be</li>
      <li><b>The Lean Startup (Eric Ries)</b> - great read, I think this relevant for each company which works in a dynamic environment </li>
      <li><b>Zwischen Stahl und Schokolade (Prodanovic; Unterhuber)</b> - interesting stories of austrian businesses and the people behind</li>
      <li><b>Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning (Christopher Bishop)</b> - I read the whole book in my first term of my Master.
        I understood around 10% of it so maybe it was a waste of time. But it's an amazing source and I reference it to this date</li>
      <li><b>Deep Learning (Ian Goodfellow)</b> - same as above</li>
