    <h3>Personal Projects</h3>
    <p><b>Beginnings</b> </p>
     <p>
        Unfortunately, I never came into contact with coding from a young age. None of the people I knew were developers.
        As a teenager, I was afraid that I could destroy my computer by doing something wrong, so I never tried actual
        coding, although I loved doing things on my computer. I attended a Handelsakademie (HAK) and chose the IT focus
        there. But here as well, we never did more than a double for loop in VBA. So my first contact with "real" coding
        was at university.
    </p>
    <p>
        This resulted in this
        <a href="/documents/first-python-programm.py" target="_blank">hilarious tic-tac-toe game</a>,
        where I wrote 864 lines of code ... xD
    </p>
        <div class="image-content">
            <img src="/images/first-python-program.png" alt="My Database Design">
        </div>

    <p><b>Intermediate</b> </p>
   <p>
       After gaining a couple of years of experience through university projects and internships, I reached a point
       where I needed to address a personal challenge. I often played computer games late into the night, which negatively
       impacted my academic progress. However, I couldn't find any tools that met my needs—or at least, none that I was
       comfortable granting the necessary privileges to. As a result, I decided to create my own solution:
       <a href="https://github.com/Steveineiter/auto_close_programs/tree/main" target="_blank">auto_close_programs</a>.
       This was an exhilarating experience because it allowed me to <b>solve a real-world problem</b> in a straightforward way.
       It taught me that a useful program doesn’t always have to be overly complex.
    </p>

    <p>
        After that, I explored various branches of computer science, diving into areas like <b>game development</b>,
        <b>information security/ethical hacking</b>, and <b>networking</b>. For instance, I experimented with setting up a Minecraft
        server on a Raspberry Pi and explored other use cases for the device. These experiences allowed me to broaden my
        skill set and gain hands-on exposure to different fields.

    </div>

    <p><b>Future</b> </p>
    <p>
        After exploring many different fields, I’ve discovered that <b>machine learning</b> and <b>full-stack engineering</b>
        are where I truly belong. These areas resonate with me because they offer the potential to solve a wide range of
        real-world problems. I’m particularly excited about the possibilities we can unlock by combining machine learning
        with robust engineering practices to create innovative and impactful solutions. I look forward to contributing
        to this ever-evolving field and seeing what we can achieve through the power of machine learning and code.

    <h3>TU Graz Data Team</h3>
    <p>
        I was part of the TU Graz Data Team for three terms.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the summer of 2022, I collaborated with Hussain Hussain on the
        <a href="https://www.dgl.ai/WSDM2022-Challenge/" target="_blank">WSDM2022-Challenge</a>. During this time, I gained valuable insights into graph-based methods from Hussain. However, I wasn’t able to contribute as much as I would have liked, as most of my time was dedicated to other subjects.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the winter of 2024, I participated in two challenges. The first was the
        <a href="https://thinkonward.com/app/c/challenges/two-birds" target="_blank">Xeek - Two Birds, One Neural Network</a>
        challenge, where we achieved <b>first place</b>. I must note that Thomas Wedenig carried out the majority of the heavy
        lifting in this project. The second was the
        <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/optiver-trading-at-the-close" target="_blank">
            Optiver - Trading at the Close
        </a> Kaggle challenge, where our team secured a <b>silver medal (top 5%)</b> using LightGBM.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the summer of 2024, I worked on the
        <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/home-credit-credit-risk-model-stability" target="_blank">
            Home Credit - Credit Risk Model Stability
        </a> Kaggle challenge, where we ranked 1443 out of 3856 participants. This challenge was particularly difficult due to frequent changes in the evaluation criteria and the fact that the system was hackable, which ultimately led to a loss of motivation within the team.

        <h3>This Project</h3>
        <p><b>Introduction</b></p>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/Steveineiter/stefan-schoerkmeier" target="_blank">This project</a> is meant to showcase <b>my development process</b>. One key lesson I’ve learned is that
            <b>strong fundamentals are essential</b>—after all, you can’t build a house on sand, right? With a solid
            foundation, building <b>high-quality, scalable, flexible, and robust applications</b> becomes more
            straightforward, albeit not necessarily easy. The goal is always to ensure the application can grow and
            adapt in the future.</p>

        <p><b>My Process</b></p>
        <p>Here’s how I approached this project:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Conceptualization:</b> I started by forming a rough idea of what I wanted to achieve—a reactive
                frontend with machine learning (ML) integration and a backend, each running in its own container.</li>
            <li><b>Technology Research:</b> I selected the necessary tools for the project: Svelte, FastAPI, Docker,
                GitHub Actions, and AWS for deployment. Each of these technologies was chosen based on their ability
                to meet specific project needs and to get experience with cutting edge technology.</li>
            <li><b>Skill Building:</b> Since I lacked strong knowledge in CI/CD, I took the time to complete courses
                on Docker, GitHub Actions, AWS, and CI/CD in general to bridge those gaps.</li>
            <li><b>Planning:</b> I designed a future version of the application, outlining all desired features, and
                created a document and timeline to guide the development process.</li>
            <li><b>Iterative Development:</b> I adopted an iterative approach: implementing, testing, gathering
                feedback, designing/planning, and learning. The main focus was on achieving a
                <b>Minimum Viable Product (MVP)</b>. At this stage, I accepted that not everything would follow
                best practices, as the primary goal was to release something functional and learn what to prioritize
                moving forward.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>My initial design:</p>
        <div class="image-content">
            <img src="/images/initial-design.png" alt="Initial Design">
        </div>

        <p><b>Reflection and Learning</b></p>
        <p>Through feedback from friends and self-reflection, I’ve gained a clearer understanding of where I need to
            improve. For example, I realized that <b>frontend development and writing</b> required much more effort
            than I initially anticipated. This realization highlighted the need to strengthen my fundamentals in CSS,
            JavaScript, and TypeScript. While my expertise lies in backend development and machine learning,
            <b>continuous reflection and learning</b> are critical, no matter how experienced we are.</p>

        <p>This project reflects not only my technical skills but also my ability to plan, iterate, and adapt.
            It’s a testament to my belief in building strong foundations and continuously improving through feedback
            and learning. While there’s always room for growth, this process has allowed me to sharpen my expertise
            in multiple areas and create something I'm proud of.</p>
