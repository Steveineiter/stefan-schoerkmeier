## Ideas
-  create a canvas where an user can draw, and then 1. recognize which they wrote and 2. create a image from that (eg given a word, create s cool signature). See [svelte tutorial for canvas]( https://svelte.dev/tutorial/svelte/actions)
-  create a NN visualization, i think thats cool to see.
-  start with a picture of myself which gets recognized from a ml model (eg short video) and which says 90% human or so and say you can trust me im 90% human lol
- Roman mentioned that it would be nice to have something like a doodle, and then AI generates an image from that. Maybe add a prompt as well.
-  show all parts of ML aka 1. predition with nn and letter recognizing, then generation (doodle to art), then innovation eg draw a arrow left/right to come to other pages or 1, 2, 3 to come to home about etc.
-  a llm chatbot which answers questions about me and mainly to get feedback from the user.
- Or for generation create a **cute dog/cat** generater and learn what people like more and show this to them (given gender, age, ..)
  
### Optional
-  something like finding fastest path in random world (and compare that with A*), or user draws obstacles and RL-agent must find way out.
  - Or an algo which doesn't predict optimal but the steps of a human (given a fixed env) 
-  visualization of other algos.

## Design
- Elias uses Fimga, Emre mentioned moqups.com and DrawIO are nice. What i have seen Penpot could be great as well.
- Check out [chat](https://www.notion.so/Active-Stuffses-473f9c31d1164d3c830e15c98ba69888?pvs=97#294ef8386774466ea2525b5383f4a5e2) and check other blogs/posts.
- Check out [svelt pages]( https://github.com/w3cj/svelte-5-tasks-app/tree/main) and other svelte based public projects for inspiration
- Check out [web of devs](https://webofdevs.com/ ) i like the design of https://raphaelameaume.com/ and https://antfu.me/ 
- Mby create a generative background, like in [chat](https://you.com/search?q=how+to+generate+background+as+in+https%3A%2F%2Fraphaelameaume.com%2Fde+and+https%3A%2F%2Fantfu.me%2F%0A%0Aso+eg+a+growing+tree%3F&fromSearchBar=true&tbm=youchat&chatMode=custom&cid=c0_009e6455-60e2-4e80-ae45-4066d81613c7) but obviously much more sufficicated.
- [dotbite](https://dotbite.at/de/webentwicklung?gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjw7dm-BhCoARIsALFk4v8FYDrB6D8BZ9lssPjSIksTTQ_vi5A3ktEbGsFJ_yLYo6QBjeGpmgMaAmViEALw_wcB) has a nice design as well.

## Tabs
- Home
- About
- Certificats / archivements
- ML
- (mby) projects from udemy/lvs (game dev, ros/camera drones, ...),
  - (mby) also thing from leetcode etc, or build my own linked list / tree which is easy but maybe still cool for people to see.
  - Other proejcts which i will build in future like a smart mirror or so
